# 🚦 GreenSched AI – Intelligent Traffic Signal Scheduling

**GreenSched AI** is a **real-time traffic signal optimization system** that leverages **machine learning, environmental analytics, and scheduling algorithms** to manage traffic flow at intersections.  
Think of it as the *AI-powered brain* that decides **which traffic light should turn green next** — smarter, faster, and more adaptive than traditional fixed timers.

## 🌍 Problem Being Solved

Traditional traffic signals rely on **fixed timers** (e.g., 30s green → 5s yellow → 25s red).  
This approach is inefficient because **traffic patterns constantly change** throughout the day.  

### Key Issues with Fixed Timing:
- 🚗 Long idle times for lanes with no traffic  
- 🚑 Delayed response to emergencies  
- 🌫️ Higher fuel consumption and emissions  
- ⏳ Longer average wait times  

---

## 🤖 Our Solution

GreenSched AI dynamically adjusts traffic lights in **real-time**, based on:  
- Vehicle queue length  
- Emergency vehicle detection  
- Environmental factors (air quality, emissions, weather)  
- Historical + live traffic patterns  

By combining **machine learning** with **smart scheduling**, the system continuously **learns and adapts** to optimize traffic flow.
